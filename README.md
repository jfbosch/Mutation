# Mutation

## Introduction
Mutation is a .NET productivity tool that provides configurable global hotkeys for essential accessibility and workflow tasks. It lets you toggle microphones, capture screens, run Optical Character Recognition (OCR), convert speech to text, and process text with LLMs—all powered by Azure Vision Services, OpenAI, Deepgram, and other APIs.

## Features

### 1. Toggle Microphone Mute  
Press one hotkey to mute or unmute every enabled microphone system-wide—independent of which meeting app or input device you use. A real-time waveform visualisation shows microphone input levels, and audio beeps confirm the current mute state.

**Hotkey:** `MicrophoneToggleMuteHotKey`

### 2. Screen Capturing and OCR  
Mutation supports two OCR reading orders via Azure **Computer Vision**:

* **Natural layout** – reads top-to-bottom within each column, then left-to-right across columns. Best for newspapers, journals, brochures, or any multi-column PDF.  
* **Basic layout** – reads strictly left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Best for tables, spreadsheets, forms, invoices, or any row-oriented content.

**Hotkeys:**

| Hotkey | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ScreenshotHotKey` | Captures the full screen and lets you draw a rectangle with a crosshair cursor (press **Esc** to cancel); the selected region is copied to the clipboard. |
| `OcrHotKey` | OCR the clipboard image with **Natural** layout. |
| `ScreenshotOcrHotKey` | Take a screenshot and OCR it with **Natural** layout in one step. |
| `OcrLeftToRightTopToBottomHotKey` | OCR the clipboard image with **Basic** layout. |
| `ScreenshotLeftToRightTopToBottomOcrHotKey` | Take a screenshot and OCR it with **Basic** layout in one step. |
| `SendHotkeyAfterOcrOperation` | Sends a specified hotkey after OCR completes (e.g., to trigger screen reader). |

**Additional Options:**
- `InvertScreenshot` – inverts screenshot colours (useful for accessibility)
- `UseFreeTier` – respects Azure free tier limits by default
- `FreeTierPageLimit` – limits pages per PDF on free tier (default: 2)
- `MaxParallelDocuments` / `MaxParallelRequests` – concurrency controls for paid tiers
- `MaxDocumentBytes` – caps upload size to avoid unexpectedly large files

### 3. Speech to Text Conversion  
Press one hotkey to start recording, press it again to stop and send the audio for transcription. Supported providers:

* OpenAI Whisper family (gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-4o-mini-transcribe)  
* Deepgram nova-3  
* Groq Whisper
* Any service exposing an OpenAI-compatible Whisper API

**Hotkeys:**

| Hotkey | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SpeechToTextHotKey` | Start/stop recording for transcription. |
| `SpeechToTextWithLlmFormattingHotKey` | Start/stop recording with automatic LLM formatting applied. |
| `SendHotkeyAfterTranscriptionOperation` | Sends a specified hotkey after transcription completes. |

**Additional Features:**
- **Audio Session History:** Navigate through past recordings using session buttons; replay any previous recording.
- **Audio File Upload:** Transcribe existing audio or video files (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, OPUS, WMA, WEBM, MP4, AVI, MKV, MOV, WMV, M4V).
- **Retry Transcription:** Re-transcribe the selected session with a different provider or prompt.
- **Dictation Insert Options:** Choose between pasting, typing (SendKeys), or clipboard-only for inserting transcriptions.

### 4. LLM Processing  
Process text through OpenAI or compatible LLMs with configurable prompts. Define multiple prompts and assign each a hotkey for quick access.

**Hotkeys:**

| Hotkey | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `FormatWithLlmHotKey` | Apply the auto-run prompt to clipboard text. |
| Per-prompt `Hotkey` | Trigger a specific prompt directly. |

**Prompt Configuration:**
- Create named prompts with custom system instructions
- Mark one prompt as "AutoRun" for the default LLM action
- Assign individual hotkeys to prompts for instant access

### 5. Transcript Formatting Rules  
Apply find-and-replace rules to transcripts before or instead of LLM processing:

- **Plain** – literal text replacement
- **RegEx** – regular expression matching
- **Smart** – intelligent matching (e.g., whole word boundaries)

Rules run before LLM formatting, enabling pre-processing of transcribed text.

### 6. Hotkey Router  
Remap any global hotkey to another. When a "From" hotkey is pressed, Mutation sends the corresponding "To" hotkey instead. Useful for creating shortcut aliases or working around application conflicts.

**Configuration:**
```json
"HotKeyRouterSettings": {
  "Mappings": [
    { "FromHotKey": "Ctrl+Alt+1", "ToHotKey": "Ctrl+Shift+M" }
  ]
}
```

### 7. Custom Audio Feedback  
Replace the default system beeps with custom audio files for different actions:

- `BeepSuccessFile` – played on successful operations
- `BeepFailureFile` – played on errors
- `BeepStartFile` / `BeepEndFile` – for recording start/stop
- `BeepMuteFile` / `BeepUnmuteFile` – for microphone state changes

## Getting Started
Install the .NET 10 runtime (or newer) and run **Mutation.exe**. On first launch, the app writes *Mutation.json* and opens it in Notepad for you to configure.

## Configuration / Settings
All hotkeys are global and fully customisable. Below is a comprehensive example with every section and key.

## Backstory.
So I got tired of having to learn the hotkeys of all the different online meeting applications that I use for toggling the microphone on and off mute. As a visually impaired computer user, finding the microphone icon visually and clicking on it is not really a viable option. I'm a very heavy AutoHotKey user, and I first tried to build a solution with that, but it was clunky. I then asked a buddy of mine if he has some experience with manipulating the microphone with C#. He didn't, but he quickly put together something in LINQPad to toggle the microphone using the audio switcher library. I then took that code and started a little WinForms application that had the microphone toggle functionality wired up to a global hotkey., and I called it Mutation. As in, I could mute the microphone at any time I wanted, no matter which application I was busy working in. This was incredibly useful, but I once had the situation where Microsoft Teams was using my second microphone and not the main one, and so when I thought I was muted with mutation, the second mic was still active and the person on the call heard while I was talking to someone locally. Luckily, it wasn't too embarrassing. I then updated mutation to list all the detected microphones and to mute and unmute them all on the toggle. In that way, I could be sure that when I wanted it muted, it was definitely muted across my system, across all the microphones. This capability became indispensable to me in my daily usage and meetings.

Being almost blind, I have the problem, like many others in the same situation, where I could not really read any screenshots or images containing text. And those come along more often than you realize in my kind of work. So, what I did was to provision myself a free Microsoft Computer Vision resource on my Azure subscription and wired up a hotkey that grabs an image from the clipboard, performs OCR on it, and puts the text back on the clipboard. Suddenly, Mutation became even more useful. This worked great for images that came our way over emails or instant messages, etc., but if I wanted to create my own screenshot of a portion of the screen, I still had to use a third-party application to put the screenshot on the clipboard. I decided, why can't mutation do that for me as well? So I extended it with the capability, again wired up to a hotkey, to take a screenshot of the entire application and then allow a rectangle selection with the mouse. At the end of the mouse drag, the image would be copied automatically onto the clipboard. I added a second hotkey that combined the screenshot and the OCR into an automated process. Now I could press a hotkey, select a rectangle on the screen, OCR was automatically performed and the text was placed on the clipboard. At which point I can just press another hotkey to read the contents of the clipboard with my screen reader.

Being extremely impressed with the OpenAI Whisper model's capability of speech-to-text while using the ChatGPT app on my iPhone, I wanted to start using it on my desktop as well. I tried using the OpenAI Whisper model on my local computer for dictation. I downloaded an application called Buzz that wrapped the model. Unfortunately, using the smaller models did not have very accurate transcription and using the larger models was unbelievably slow on my development workstation.
So I decided to wire up Mutation to record an MP3 when I press a hotkey, and then send that MP3 to the OpenAI Whisper API for transcription, and then to put the text back on the clipboard, at which point it's again available for my screen reader, or just to paste into a document. Typically, this is very fast for dictating a couple of sentences. It only takes one to three seconds to come back with the text.
In fact, I'm using mutation and whisper to dictate this entire backstory of mutation. This feature is quite the productivity booster. I find it saves me a lot of time, as for a lot of messages, even short messages, like on WhatsApp or Slack, it's much faster to speak them and then paste the resulting text than to type it out.

I don't think many people will use mutation, but I'm sure there will be a few that will find the kind of productivity boosting that it can give incredibly useful. and thus the open-source project was born.
For myself, it is absolutely indispensable, and I could not go a day without it anymore. I will add to it as I think of more tools to make my life easier.

Here's hoping it helps somebody else as well.
